# Simple UserApp PHP Application

## Trying it out

1. Log into UserApp and retrieve your AppId. 
2. Create a new token and call it 'Demo Application' (don't forget to activate it).
3. Open the file `app_init.php` and edit it so it contains your AppId and Token that you just created.
4. Voila, now you're all set. Try going to `signup.php` and creating a new user. If you want to login with an existing user, use `login.php`.


Live long and prosper!
