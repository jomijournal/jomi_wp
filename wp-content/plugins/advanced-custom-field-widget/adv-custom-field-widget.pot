"is present, the custom field content is loaded into the variable \\"
"$acfw_content and then the evald code uses the string you put in here as the "
"basis for the widget content instead.  This allows you to generate URL's and "
"other content as the string $acfw_content in the Content Generator field "
"below is replaced by the actual content from the post.  $data1-$data5 are "
"loaded with the values from the custom key specified by Additional Data "
