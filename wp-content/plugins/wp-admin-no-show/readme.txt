Block subscribers from accessing wp-admin pages. Disable the WP Admin Bar in WordPress 3.1+.

== Description ==

This plugin will gives the site admin the ability to "blacklist" roles (<em>subscriber</em>, <em>contributor</em>, <em>author</em>, and/or <em>editor</em>) and will redirect all users assiged to any blacklisted roles when they try to access any wp-admin page (is_admin() is true). This plugin will also hide the admin bar for those users in WordPress 3.1+.

Admin users and any users belonging to any of the other WordPress roles that have not been blacklisted will continue to see and have access to the other sections of the WordPress admin that correspond to their role's capabilities.

<strong>Note: Version 1.0.0+ requires a minimum of WordPress 3.1. If you are running a version less than that, please upgrade your WordPress install before installing or upgrading.</strong>
