Sync databases across servers with a single click.

== Description ==

**WARNING:** This plugin is for advanced users. If used incorrectly it could wipe out *all your content*!

Keeping databases in sync between development, staging and live servers can be a pain. This plugin lets you
link together several WordPress installations by sharing a secret token. Once linked, administrators can pull
or push the entire database between servers with just a click.

Currently syncs database only, not uploaded files.

= Backups =

The plugin will attempt to make local backups of the database before overwriting. These are stored as gzipped SQL
files in wp-content/plugins/database-sync/backups/dbYYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.sql.gz The backups directory should be made
writable, and you should keep an eye on it if you sync often as it will grow in size.

= Usage =

See Installation instructions.

== Installation ==

1. Install as usual.
2. Activate plugin.
3. Repeat 1 & 2 on each server that you want to link.
4. Go to Tools > Database Sync on the main server and copy the token.
5. On the other server(s), go to Tools > Database Sync and paste the token.

You are now set up to pull from and push to the main server.
