The easiest way to add a high conversion Stripe Checkout form to your site and start getting paid.

== Description ==

Add a highly optimized Stripe Checkout form overlay to your site in a few simple steps.

Instead of spending time building your own checkout forms you can use Stripe's, which is continually tested for high conversion.

> "Stripe Checkout is an embeddable payment form for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It works within your site—customers can pay instantly, without being redirected away to complete the transaction."

###Plugin Requirements###

This is a simple standalone Stripe checkout plugin. That's it. No other plugins required.

Note that Stripe suggests that the pages hosting the checkout form be SSL (they should start with `https://`). [Read more about SSL](https://stripe.com/help/ssl).

###Start Accepting Payments in 3 Easy Steps###

It only takes a couple minutes to add a payment form to your site.

1. Activate the plugin, go to Settings > Simple Stripe Checkout, then enter your Stripe keys.
1. Edit the post or page where you want the payment button and checkout form to appear.
1. Add a simple shortcode.

Viola! Now a payment button that opens your checkout form in an overlay will pop up.
