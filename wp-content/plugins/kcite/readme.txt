A tool for producing citations and bibliographies in Wordpress posts.
Developed for the Knowledgeblog project (http://knowledgeblog.org).



== Description ==

Interprets the &#91;cite&#93; shortcode to produce citations from the
appropriate sources, also produces a formatted bibliography at the foot of the
post, with appropriate links to articles.

This plugin now uses multiple resources to retrieve metadata about the
references in question, including CrossRef, DataCite, arXiv, PubMed and
arbitrary URLs.

Additional documentation is available at
[Process](http://process.knowledgeblog.org/category/kcite). 

**Syntax**

DOI Example - &#91;cite source='doi'&#93;10.1021/jf904082b&#91;/cite&#93;

PMID example - &#91;cite source='pubmed'&#93;17237047&#91;/cite&#93;

Whichever 'source' is identified as the default (see Installation), will work
without the source attribute being set in the shortcode. so:

&#91;cite&#93;10.1021/jf904082b&#91;/cite&#93;

Will be interpreted correctly as long as DOI is set as the default metadata
source.

Kcite now supports DOIs from both [CrossRef](http://www.crossref.org) and
[DataCite](http://www.datacite.org). Identifiers from
[PubMed](http://www.pubmed.org) or [arXiv](http://www.arxiv.org) are directly
supported. URLs are supported via
[Greycite](http://greycite.knowledgeblog.org).


From Kcite 1.4, Citeproc-js
(https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home) is used to render the
bibliography on the browser; the main visible change it that Author-Year
citation is used. There is now experimental support for reader switching. This
must be enabled in the settings page as it is off by default. 

Kcite is developed at http://code.google.com/p/knowledgeblog/ in Mercurial. To
contact the authors, please email knowledgeblog@googlegroups.com.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the downloaded .zip archive to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

= 1.6.1 = 

1. Fixed problem with in-built render giving links of form [ITEM-8-1]
1. Improvements to presentation of in-built renderer
1. Citeproc rendering disabled in feeds, as many RSS readers cannot cope
1. Kcite can selects appropriate sources for bare URLs

1. Kcite now requires the PHP libcurl support. You may need to install
   additional packages on your web server. 
1. From kcite 1.5, we have expanded the range of identifiers.
   DataCite DOIs and arXiv IDs are now supported. 
1. Crossref DOIs are now accessed via content negotiation. This should be less
   buggy, and reduce server load as it removes a parsing/data integration
   step. 
1. DataCite DOIs come via content negotiation also, although still require XML
   parsing. 
1. Bug fix to in kcite.js should fix an occasional rendering bug.
