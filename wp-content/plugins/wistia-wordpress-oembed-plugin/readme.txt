Enables all Wistia embed types to be used in your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Wistia's embed codes are designed to be very durable, but WordPress has a
history of being particularly troublesome. This plugin transparently makes
sure that your Wistia embeds will work, no matter what you do.

As of version 0.6 of this plugin, it is recommended that you check
"Use oEmbed?" under Advanced Options when generating your embed code.

See the Wistia documentation for more:
