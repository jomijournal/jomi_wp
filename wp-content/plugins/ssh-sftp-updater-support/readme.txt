"SSH SFTP Updater Support" is the easiest way to keep your Wordpress installation up-to-date with SFTP.

== Description ==

Keeping your Wordpress install up-to-date and installing plugins in a hassle-free manner is not so easy if your server uses SFTP. "SSH SFTP Updater Support" for Wordpress uses phpseclib to remedy this deficiency.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the files to the `/wp-content/plugins/ssh-sftp-updater-support` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
