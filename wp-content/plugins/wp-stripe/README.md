# Introduction

Stripe is a great payment solution already disrupting the market for receiving payments online. It's built by developers and really looks awesome.

## Development Purpose

* Provide Charities & Non-Profits with a simple mechanism for receiving payments online.

## Development Goals

* Receiving Donations - 100%
* Create a complete "Project" feature (i.e. associating individual donations to projects, showing funding status and more) - 30%
* Recurring Donations - 0%

## Development No No's

* Creating an E-Commerce solution. There are plenty of free & premium plug-ins out there filling that gap.

## Pull Requests

* Certainly open to any enhancements. For larger changes, maybe you want to open an issue first and check with me as to how we can best implement it, thanks!
	
## Support

We can't actually help you with CSS, XHTML, PHP & JS so there's a certain degree of self-reliance that's required if you'd like to implement. It doesn't mean I won't guide you on the right path, but we'd like to keep the discussions relevant to bugs, enhancements and features.
